\section{Framing the research}

 \begin{frame}{Our starting point}

        {\bf Symbolic artificial social cognition}:
        works rather well as long as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item we know what we want to do (in terms of task domain,
                \& declarative knowledge)
            \item interaction mostly relying on symbolic \emph{perceptual inputs}
                (including visual perspective taking) rather abstract or less
                explicit representations
        \end{itemize}
        \pause

        Good for any practical HRI purposes? {\bf mostly}!
        \pause

        However, {\bf it does not explain much about how social cognition actually
        work}.

        Intuitively, social modeling goes beyond computing what the human
        perceives or does not perceive $\rightarrow$ Flavell's \emph{cognitive
        connections} vs \emph{mental representations}.

 \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A long-term direction}

    Adapting and unifying the large and disparate set of theories on social
    cognition to {\bf build a theory of social cognition for
    robots}

    \pause
    ...or rather, {\bf a computational model of social cognition for robots}

    \pause

    ...or rather, an {\bf embodied} computational model of social cognition?

    \footnotesize (we'll come back to this in a moment)

\begin{frame}{One question}

    \Large
    \centering

    Can sociality emerge from interaction?

    \pause
    \normalsize
    \vspace{2em}

    Both ``emerge'' as \emph{arise from} and ``emerge`` as in \emph{emergent paradigm of
    cognition}!

    \pause

    ``Social cognition arising in interaction''? certainly looks like a situated \&
    embodied view on cognition

    Cognition}, 2011}
\begin{frame}{A model?}

    Models attempt to \emph{explain}: 
    \begin{quote}
        ``identifying the causes for an event or phenomenon of interest''
    \end{quote}
    \begin{quote}
        ``unifying disparate phenomena''
    \end{quote}

        A model's value is gained from
    \begin{quote}
        ``predicting facts that, absent the theory, would be antecedently
        improbable''
    \end{quote}

    \pause

    ...we will come back to the predictive power of a model of artifical social
    cognition.

\section{Back to the question}

\begin{frame}{A model of artificial social cognition}

    I postulate {\bf two stages}:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item building models of others' minds
        \item exploiting these models to socially act:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item prediction, reading others' intentions
                \item adapting own behaviour, alignment
                \item establish join goals
                \item ultimately, performing joint actions
            \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

    \vspace{2em}
    $\rightarrow$ Social analogs of \emph{perception} \& \emph{action}

\end{frame}

{
    \paper{see discussion in Vernon, {\bf Artificial Cognitive Systems: A Primer} 2014}
\begin{frame}{Cognitivist vs Emergent paradigms}

    ``building'', ``exploiting'', ``reading'', ``establishing''... my terminolgy
    denotes a cognitivist approach (`I, the designer of the system, explicitly implement
    these capabilities')

    \pause
    
    Reformulation in the emergent paradigm:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item developing internal states \emph{connoting} others' minds
        \item perturbing (influencing) actions synthesis with these states
    \end{enumerate}

    \pause

    Hybrid approaches are possible -- mapping to ``phenomenal experience'' vs
    ``access counciousness''.
\end{frame}
}

\begin{frame}{Sketching a path forward: mentalizing}

    {\bf Hypothesis 1}: Graziano is right: mental representations are snapshots of
    \emph{awareness}, \emph{awareness} being itself a label for the
    \emph{memory-mediated process of attention}.

    \pause

    {\bf Hypothesis 2}: this can be extended to social cognition. \textbf{Modeling one
    other mental representations equates to taking snapshots of their current
    state of awareness}.

    As we do not have direct access to others' process of attention, it has to
    be mediated. Following Graziano, we hypotesise that \textbf{modelling other's
    state of awareness is mediated by one's own attentional system, through
    joint attention mechanisms}.

            process of attention}

        \item<+-> attention at time t is the label we put on the set of the {\bf
            activated units} in a (biased) {\bf associative memory network}

        \item<+-> modelling {\bf others’ mental representations} is taking
            snapshots of their own current state of awareness

        \item<+-> modelling other’s state of awareness, \ie their current
            attentional process, is {\bf mediated by one’s own attentional
            system}, typically through {\bf joint attention} mechanisms

        \item<+-> Points 1 to 5 essentially refer to a \emph{phenomenal}
            awareness (a \emph{raw} inner experience). \emph{Phenomenal}
            awareness can be turned into \emph{access consciousness} (the
            abstract, cognitive ability to reflect on the inner experience)

        \item<+-> In robots, \emph{access consciousness} can be mapped to {\bf
            symbolic representations}

\begin{frame}{An hybrid model of cognition}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{phenomenal experience} modelled in a connectionist
            (sub-symbolic) fashion (associative
    memory network)
\item \emph{access conciousness} in a cognitivist (symbolic) fashion (typically,
    an ontology or epistemic logics)

    \end{itemize}

    $\Rightarrow$ bottom-up

    \pause

    The \emph{Biased Competition Model of Attention} supports bottom-up as well
    as {\bf top-down biasing mechanisms}: 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{bottom-up}: if a unit is
            activated longer/stronger, it biases the resulting attention to this
            unit.
        \item \emph{top-down}: abstract cognitive process can influence the memory network
            to bias the attention process. Practically less clear, but also potentially very interesting
            as it {\bf closes the loop between the emergent and cognitivist
            paradigms}

    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item<+-> mental representations as instantaneous 'snapshots' is a {\bf strong

        \item<+-> if attention is the set of activated units in a memory network,
            {\bf what are the units?} physical entities? social events? situations?
            what is the right level of abstraction: from raw perceptual inputs to
            high-level units like objects, joint gazing, etc.


        \item<+-> {\bf the mapping} between 'phenomenal consciousness' and
            'access consciousness' and, respectively, sub-symbolic and symbolic
            computational structures {\bf might be naive}. This need to be
            better evidenced, if only because the frontier between phenomenal
            and access consciousness is all but clear (as pointed by Graziano).

        \item<+-> what is the {\bf social motivation} for the robot to carry
            over this modeling? What social drives?

        \item<+-> at epistemic level, if access to other's mental
            representations is \emph{mediated} by one's own attentional system,
            these mental representations are subjective. {\bf Can we equate humans'
            and robots' subjectivities?}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ballard's (and Anderson's extension) coding of children's free-play interactions
        \item behavioural alignment between partners: for instance, using
            Słowinski's \emph{Individual Motor Signature}
    \end{itemize}

    The most obvious one: {\bf what cognitive architecture?}

    $\rightarrow$ will draw from hybrid architectures (CLARION), internal
    simulation (HAMMER), sub-symbolic cognitive architecture (ERA)

    ...but not many cognitive architectures model social interactions! (on BICA
    website, about 0 actually!)

    \pause
    
    The second most obvious one: {\bf what are the inputs?} low-level?
    high-level? To reconstruct someone else's attentional state, Graziano suggests:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item gaze direction
        \item facial expression
        \item body language
        \item prior knowledge of person
        \item location of salient objects
    \end{itemize}

    Probably not the end of it, though!
